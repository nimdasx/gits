brew openjdk

For the system Java wrappers to find this JDK, symlink it with
  sudo ln -sfn /usr/local/opt/openjdk@21/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-21.jdk

openjdk@21 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have openjdk@21 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openjdk@21/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find openjdk@21 you may need to set:
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openjdk@21/include"
